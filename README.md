Face Crime
==========

At GitHub we have a really nice designer named [Jon Rohan](https://github.com/jonrohan).
We used to put his face on a lot of things in our Campfire chat.

Recently, [faceup.me](http://faceup.me), stopped putting Jon Rohan in our
pictures.  This app is a tiny sinatra web app that uses RubyCocoa to put Jon
Rohan's face back on any image we want.
